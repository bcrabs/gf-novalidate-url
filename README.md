Gravity Forms validates URL fields and requires a protocol prefix form submission. Without a prompt, users forget to add or simply want to type naked domain.
This causes the form submission to fail, thus leading to an extra step and possibly preventing a lead or creating a secondary issue.
Add the snippet to functions.php and save.
